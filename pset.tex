\begin{exercise}
	Suppose $f $ is a complex continuous function in $\R^n $, with compact support. Prove that $\psi P_j \to f $ uniformly on $\R^n $, for some $\psi \in \mathscr{D} $ and for some sequence $\{P_j\}   $ of polynomials.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
	Show that the metrizable topology for $\mathscr{D}(\Omega) $ that was rejected in Section 6.2 is not complete for any $\Omega $.
\end{exercise}

\begin{execrise}
	If $E $ is an arbitrary closed subset of $\R^n $, show that there is an $f \in C^\infty(\R^n) $ such that $f(x) = 0 $ for every $x \in E $ and $f(x) > 0 $ for every other $x\in \R^n $.
\end{execrise}

\begin{exercise}
	Suppose $\Lambda \in \mathscr{D}'(\Omega) $ and $\Lambda \phi  \ge 0 $. Prove that $\Lambda $ is then a positive measure in $\Omega $ (which is finite on compact sets).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
	Prove that the numbers $c_{\alpha \beta} $ in the Leibniz formula are
	\[
		c_{\alpha \beta} = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{\alpha_i!}{\beta_i! (\alpha_i - \beta_i)!}
	.\] 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
	~
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Suppose $c_m = \exp \{-(m!)!\} , m = 0,1,2,\ldots  $. Does the series
			\[
				\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} c-M(D^m \phi )(0)
			\] 
			converge for every $\phi \in C^\infty(\R) $.
		\item Let $\Omega $ be open in $\R^n $, suppose $\Lambda_i \in \mathscr{D}'(\Omega) $, and suppose that all $\Omega_i $ have their supports in some fixed compact $K \subset \Omega $. Prove that the sequence $\{\Lambda_i\}   $ cannot converge in $\mathscr{D}'(\Omega) $ unless the orders of the $\Lambda_j $ are bounded.
			\ifhint
				Hint: Use the Banach-Steinhaus Theorem.
			\fi
		\item Can the assumption about the supports be dropped in (b)?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
